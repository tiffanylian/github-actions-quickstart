# github-actions-quickstart
Introduction to adding actions to repository.

Feedback to documentation found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/quickstart):

"This doc was extremely helpful and beginner-friendly! It would be interesting for there to be an introduction on what the Actions tab does/what workflows are as well as how YAML files accomplish that. I think beginners would appreciate more context on concepts such as jobs, steps, and runner."
